This folder contains example data to be used for testing DySART fitting
parameters.

Feel free to add more.

Each folder corresponds to a 'category' of measurements, and within each folder
is one (or more) subfolder(s), whose name corresponds to the cooldown, from
which the data inside the folder was taken. This allows us to go back and dig
out the relevant data from the relevant measurements folder, should we want
to double check anything.
